# UPDuino-LH154Q01-Display
Design to connect Lattice Ultraplus FPGA to LH154Q01 Display

UPDuino is a small maker board with a Lattice Ultraplus mobile FPGA.  The UPDuino LH154 Display Adapter Board provides the ability to attach a small 240x240 24-bit RGB display that has been used for many electronic devices including the iPod Nano (6th generation).  The FPGA can be used as a small graphics processor to deliver interactive graphics, bitmaps, fonts/text on the display.
